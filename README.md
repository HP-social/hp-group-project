## Preplanning

### Component Tree

Below is the initial component tree that we wrote out during our preplanning phase

### Schema

## Messages

Here is an example of our group collaboratively working and iterating through the direct messaging (DM) view(s). For simplicity, we originally envisioned a singular view to house all of the functionality.

### Mobile Version One

Our original design took inspiration from the NewsFeed view that we developed.

### Mobile Version Two

Upon further development we decided that a more intuitive approach for the user would be to split up the views for mobile.

### Design Iteration FTW

However, from the UX perspective --- a singular view didn't make sense because there was too much functionality which was taking away from the primary functionality of a private DM environment with minimal distractions. In the end, we decided to reduce UX ambiguity by maximizing the messaging real estate, and splitting the DMs into to two separate views.
